    <h1>What does CSS stands for?</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets
      HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for
      building Web pages.
      Css works through a syntax of codes that have their own rules and work on the visual presentation. When a
      developer applies this CSS code to the structure of a page it is stored together with other information on that
      page. This can include text content, animations, videos and whatever else has been inserted.
      So when a user accesses a website, the browser organizes all this data and displays the stylized visual elements
      on the screen. This is the combination of languages that happens on most websites so that users feel more
      attracted to continue accessing the page.
