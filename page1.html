    <h1>What does HTML stands for?</h1>

    <p>
    <h2>Hypertext Markup Language</h2>
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.<br> For example,
    content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
    Whenever we enter a web page the resulting interface, in most cases is obtained through layers with different
    functions. Each layer is represented by a specific language.
    The most common are the following three: HTML is the layer that presents the content, it is responsible for
    displaying the content giving it meaning. CSS is the layer that gives form to the elements of the HTML, selects an
    element<br> of the HTML to stylize it and presents it as a new form in the browser. And finally the JavaScript layer
    that adds dynamic behaviour, for example when filling out a form we miss the e-mail and the system warns us.
    Most major websites use some kind of server-side technology to dynamically display different data as needed. For
    example, imagine how many products are available on Amazon and imagine how many posts have been written on
    Facebook?<br> Displaying all of that using completely different static pages would be completely inefficient, so
    instead these sites display static templates (built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and then dynamically update
    the data displayed within those templates as needed
    HTML documents are files with the extensions .html or .htm. They can be viewed with any browser (such as Google
    Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the file and renders its contents for users to view.
    Common websites usually have several HTML pages. For example: homepages, pages explaining the purpose of the site,
    and contact pages would all have different HTML documents.
    Each HTML page consists of a series of tags, which can be thought of as the building blocks of the pages. They
    create a hierarchy that structures the content between sections, paragraphs, headings and other content blocks.
    Most HTML elements use opening and closing syntax such as /tag and /tag.
    <h3>Client-side</h3>
    The client-side of an application is where it is processed, in the case of the web, it executes in the client's
    browser
    which is responsible for interacting with the HTTP Server. Among the client-side technologies we have HTML that is
    executed
    in the browser, CSS is another client technology that is used to format HTML pages, there is also javascript that
    allows
    you to develop or extend the power of the client side.
    <h4>Server-side </h4>
    Server-side, in turn, is the term that represents the set of technologies in which the processes
    are interpreted/processed directly on the server, returning the client-side coding as a result.
    When a network user accesses a web page, a request is sent to the server through the http protocol
    so that the server sends a response. The Server besides running the applications, the server side
    is also a repository of static pages, which will be sent to the client when requested. Assuming there is a JSP page,
    it will be processed by the server and forwarded a response to the Browser.
