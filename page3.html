    <h1>What does JavaScript stands for?</h1>
    <p>JavaScript abbreviated as JS, is a programming language. It has key syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object orientation and first-class functions.

      Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the main technologies on the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables
      interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
      client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a JavaScript engine to run it.

      JavaScript supports event-oriented, functional and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
      interfaces (APIs) to work with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures and the Document Object
      Model.
